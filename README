modstorm.so: Ganglia module to get metrics from StoRM heartbeat.log
===================================================================

General description:
====================

"storm-ganglia" is a ganglia module to monitor a StoRM service instance. 
StoRM is an implementations of a "Storage Resource Manager" (SRM) version
2.2 currently developed and distributed by the EMI project.

The "storm-ganglia" module collects several metrics taken from one of the
StoRM log files, namely the "heartbeat.log". The collected metrics are the
"Heap free" memory (in bytes), the number synchronous requests, the number of
asynchronous "Prepare to Put (PTP)" and "Prepare To Get (PTG)" requests, the
number of synchronous requests, the average time for the synchronous requests,
and the number of failed requests.

This set of metrics allows to have a glance on the service's load in terms of
number of SRM requests, as well as if there is any failure in the service.  

The heartbeat.log file is updated on a regular basis with a new line containing
the summary of collected metrics. The default timeframe is one minute.

The "storm-ganglia" package includes the module itself as a shared library and
the gmond configuration file.

Installation:
=============

There are two tarballs containing the a pre-compiled .so module and a gmond
config file. To be installed in the StoRM backend machine:

	- storm-ganglia_ganglia317-1.0.3-1.tgz
		- Compiled in SL5 x86_64
		- Ganglia 3.1.7

	- storm-ganglia_ganglia320-1.0.3-1.tgz
		- Compiled in SL5 x86_64
		- Ganglia 3.2.0

If you download any of those tgz:
	# cp storm-ganglia_ganglia317-1.0.3-1.tgz /
	# tar zxvf storm-ganglia_ganglia317-1.0.3-1.tgz
	# /etc/init.d/gmond restart

Known issues:
=============

gmond has to have permissions to read the heartbeat.log file, if gmond is
running with user "nobody" it may not be possible to read the log file a
workaround is to run gmond under user "storm". Security implications are still
to be evaluated.
	Edit: /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf and change
	      "user = nobody" by 
	      "user = storm", before restarting gmond

Compilation:
=======================================================

You need to install:
	- apr-devel
	- apr-util-devel
	- ganglia-devel
	- libconfuse-devel

Run the script:
	# ./comp-mod.sh
