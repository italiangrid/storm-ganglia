modstorm.so: Ganglia module to get metrics from StoRM heartbeat.log
===================================================================

General description:
====================

"storm-ganglia" is a ganglia module to monitor a StoRM service instance. 
StoRM is an implementations of a "Storage Resource Manager" (SRM) version
2.2 currently developed and distributed by the EMI project.

The "storm-ganglia" module collects several metrics taken from one of the
StoRM log files, namely the "heartbeat.log". The collected metrics are the
"Heap free" memory (in bytes), the number of asynchronous "Prepare to Put (PTP)"
and "Prepare To Get (PTG)" requests, the number of synchronous requests,
the average time for the synchronous requests, and the number of failed requests.

This set of metrics allows to have a glance on the service's load in terms of
number of SRM requests, as well as if there is any failure in the service.  

The heartbeat log file is updated on a regular basis with a new line containing
the summary of collected metrics. The default timeframe is one minute.

The "storm-ganglia" package includes the module itself as a shared library and
the gmond configuration file.

Installation:
=============

The tarball contains the source code and a pre-compiled .so module.
To be installed in the StoRM frontend machine.
- Compiled in SL5 x86_64
- Ganglia 3.1.7

	# tar zxvf ganglia-storm-module-1.0.0-1.tgz
	# cd ganglia-storm-module
	# cp modstorm.so /usr/lib64/ganglia/
	# cp storm_mon.conf /etc/ganglia/conf.d/
	# /etc/init.d/gmond restart

Known issues:
=============

gmond has to have permissions to read the heartbeat.log file, if
gmond is running with user "nobody" it may not be possible to read the log file
a workaround is to run gmond under user "storm". Security implications are
still to be evaluated.
	Edit: /etc/ganglia/gmond.conf and change "user = nobody" by  "user = storm", before restarting gmond

Compilation - this is needed if you have ganglia 3.2.0:
=======================================================

You need to install:
	- apr-devel
	- apr-util-devel
	- ganglia-devel
	- libconfuse-devel

Run the script:
	# ./comp.sh
